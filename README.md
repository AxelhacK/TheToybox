Welcome, This is the git where I put all of my code that I have been messing around with. I've been using it to learn whatever language it happens to be by taking it apart and messing around with what it does. Feel free to make pulls of it and mess around with it, I don't care.

If you want to see some of it in action go over to http://seth177.ddns.net and whatever script i have set to be active would show up...eventually i might figure out how to make all of them run in one script and be able to call them up with links but i haven't figured that out yet =|
