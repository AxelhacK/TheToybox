<p>Welcome, This is the git where I put all of my code that I have been messing around with. I've been using it to learn whatever language it happens to be by taking it apart and messing around with what it does. Feel free to make pulls of it and mess around with it, I don't care.</p>

<p>This will include whatever I make in whatever language it is, I will always keep this up to date. At this current moment the only code in here is JavaScript where ive made a few silly stuff while im learning JS, as well as HTML and PHP that is on my website and runs the code for me to test.</p>

<p>If you want to see some of it in action go over to <a href="http://seth177.ddns.net/secret/toybox">http://seth177.ddns.net/secret/toybox</a> and whatever script i have set to be active would show up...eventually i might figure out how to make all of them run a lot more nicely but i need to figure that out.</p>
